# Strava-Like App on Google Cloud Kubernetes (GKE)

## Core Features

A fitness-tracking app similar to Strava includes:

- User authentication and profile management
- GPS activity uploads (rides, runs, hikes)
- Social feed with comments and kudos
- Route mapping and performance stats
- Notifications and summaries

---

## High-Level Architecture Overview

### 1. Microservices on GKE

Each feature is handled by a dedicated microservice, containerized and deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine:

- **auth-service**: Login, signup, token management
- **user-service**: Profile, followers, connections
- **activity-service**: Activity upload and storage
- **route-service**: GPS parsing (e.g., `.gpx`, `.fit`) and route storage
- **feed-service**: Social feed generation
- **notification-service**: Email, push notifications
- **stats-service**: Calculates distance, pace, elevation
- **frontend-service**: Web UI or API backend for mobile

Each service uses a Kubernetes `Deployment` and `Service`.

### 2. Google Cloud Integrations

- **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**: Main container orchestration
- **Cloud Storage**: Stores raw GPS files
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**: Event-based processing (e.g., activity triggers analysis)
- **Cloud SQL or Firestore**: User and activity database
- **BigQuery (optional)**: Advanced analytics at scale
- **Cloud Load Balancing + Ingress**: HTTPS with SSL termination

---

### 3. Scalability & Resilience

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Auto-scale services like `activity-service`
- **Node Pools with Autoscaling**: Scales infrastructure on demand
- **Kubernetes Jobs / CronJobs**: For tasks like weekly summaries or cleanups

---

### 4. CI/CD and Observability

- **Cloud Build / GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Monitoring and custom dashboards
- **Cloud Logging + Monitoring**: Centralized logs and performance alerts
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing across services

---

### 5. Security and Access Control

- **Workload Identity**: GKE services access GCP APIs securely
- **IAM Roles**: Fine-grained access control
- **Secrets Manager**: Store API keys and DB credentials
- **API Gateway or Istio (optional)**: Auth, rate limiting, service mesh

---

## Typical User Flow

1. User logs in (`auth-service`)
2. Uploads a GPS file (`activity-service`)
3. File is stored in Cloud Storage and routed to `route-service`
4. Route data parsed and sent to `stats-service`
5. `feed-service` updates social feed
6. `notification-service` alerts followers
