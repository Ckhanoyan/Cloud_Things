# High Availability Setup for Strava-like Application on Google Cloud

To ensure high availability for this Strava-like application, my recommendations are below:

### 1. Global Deployment with Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)
- Deploy your application across multiple regions using **Managed Instance Groups**.
- Enable **auto-scaling** to handle dynamic workloads.
- Configure health checks to ensure traffic is routed only to healthy instances.

### 2. Global Load Balancer with Backend Services
- Use a **global external application load balancer** to distribute traffic across regions.
- Set up **traffic steering policies** and configure **failover** between regions.
- Enable **Session Affinity** if your application requires user session persistence.

### 3. High Availability for Databases
- Use **Cloud SQL** with high availability enabled for relational databases.
- Add **read replicas** in different regions for read-heavy workloads.
- If global consistency is required, consider **Cloud Spanner** as a globally distributed database solution.

### 4. Multi-Region Cloud Storage for Static Assets
- Store static assets (e.g., images, videos) in **Cloud Storage** with a multi-region or dual-region configuration for durability and availability.

### 5. Cloud CDN for Caching
- Enable **Cloud CDN** to cache content at Google's edge locations, reducing latency and ensuring availability for global users.

### 6. Event-Driven Architecture with Pub/Sub
- Use **Pub/Sub** for asynchronous tasks or events, such as activity tracking or notifications.
- This ensures reliable and scalable message distribution globally.

### 7. Monitoring and Alerts
- Set up **Cloud Monitoring** and **Cloud Logging** to track application performance and detect issues.
- Create **alert policies** to notify you in case of failures or performance degradation.

### 8. Disaster Recovery
- Implement a disaster recovery strategy by enabling **regional failover** and maintaining backups for critical databases and services.
- Periodically test your disaster recovery plan to ensure effectiveness.

### Example Architecture
1. **Frontend Layer**:
   - Global External Application Load Balancer with Cloud CDN for caching.
2. **Compute Layer**:
   - Regional Managed Instance Groups for scalability and failover.
3. **Database Layer**:
   - Cloud SQL with high availability or Cloud Spanner for global consistency.
4. **Storage Layer**:
   - Multi-region Cloud Storage for static files.
5. **Messaging**:
   - Pub/Sub for event-driven communication.

By leveraging these Google Cloud services and best practices, your application will achieve high availability, resilience, and scalability.
