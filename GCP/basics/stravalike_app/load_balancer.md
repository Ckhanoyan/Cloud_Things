For a Strava-like application where users share workout activities such as running or cycling, implementing a **Global External Application Load Balancer** is highly appropriate. Below are the key reasons:

1. **Public-Facing Application**: Since the application is public-facing and used by a global audience, a global load balancer is ideal for efficiently routing traffic worldwide.

2. **Security**: User data, including personal workout details and location information, must be transmitted securely. HTTPS ensures encrypted communication, protecting against potential data breaches.

3. **Global Accessibility**: A global external load balancer in Google Cloud provides traffic management based on geo-location. It routes user requests to the nearest backend for reduced latency and improved performance.

4. **High Availability**: With redundancy across multiple regions, the global load balancer ensures that the application remains highly available, even if one region experiences issues.

5. **Scalability**: The global load balancer can handle large traffic volumes efficiently, scaling as needed to accommodate high user demand, which is vital for a social app with fluctuating traffic.

6. **Custom Domain and SSL**: The load balancer supports custom domains (e.g., `www.stravalikeapp.com`) and SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring secure and professional communication with users.

7. **Integration with Google Cloud**: Seamless integration with other Google Cloud services simplifies application deployment and management while enabling robust monitoring and logging.

By leveraging a **Global External Application Load Balancer**, the application ensures a secure, scalable, and performant experience for users posting and viewing workout activities.

### Option B: Network Load Balancer for Real-Time Data

For applications that require real-time or near real-time updates, such as live workout tracking or leaderboard updates, a **Network Load Balancer** could be considered. The key advantages include:

1. **Low Latency**: Network Load Balancers operate at the TCP/UDP level, providing lower latency compared to Application Load Balancers, which is critical for live data updates.
2. **High Throughput**: They can handle a high number of connections simultaneously, ensuring that live updates reach all users promptly.
3. **Scalability**: Can easily scale to accommodate spikes in usage, such as during fitness challenges or live competitions.
4. **Integration with Backend Services**: Works seamlessly with backend services that need to process continuous streams of data.
5. **Simplicity**: Ideal for applications with simpler traffic distribution requirements that prioritize performance over complex routing logic.

By utilizing a **Network Load Balancer**, the application ensures fast, reliable delivery of live results, enhancing the user experience for real-time features.
