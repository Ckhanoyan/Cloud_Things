### Use Case: HTTPS Load Balancer for a Strava-like Application

For a Strava-like application where users share workout activities such as running or cycling, implementing an HTTPS load balancer is highly appropriate. Below are the key reasons:

1. **Security**: User data, including personal workout details and location information, must be transmitted securely. HTTPS ensures encrypted communication, protecting against potential data breaches.

2. **Global Accessibility**: An HTTPS load balancer in Google Cloud provides global traffic management. It routes user requests to the nearest backend for reduced latency and improved performance.

3. **Scalability**: With features like auto-scaling, the HTTPS load balancer can handle traffic spikes efficiently, which is essential for a social application with unpredictable usage patterns.

4. **Custom Domain and SSL**: The load balancer supports custom domains (e.g., `www.stravalikeapp.com`) and SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring secure and professional communication with users.

5. **Integration with Google Cloud**: Seamless integration with other Google Cloud services simplifies application deployment and management while enabling robust monitoring and logging.

By leveraging the HTTPS load balancer, the application ensures a secure, scalable, and performant experience for users posting and viewing workout activities.
