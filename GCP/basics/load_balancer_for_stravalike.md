### Use Case: Global External Application Load Balancer for a Strava-like Application

For a Strava-like application where users share workout activities such as running or cycling, implementing a **Global External Application Load Balancer** is highly appropriate. Below are the key reasons:

1. **Public-Facing Application**: Since the application is public-facing and used by a global audience, a global load balancer is ideal for efficiently routing traffic worldwide.

2. **Security**: User data, including personal workout details and location information, must be transmitted securely. HTTPS ensures encrypted communication, protecting against potential data breaches.

3. **Global Accessibility**: A global external load balancer in Google Cloud provides traffic management based on geo-location. It routes user requests to the nearest backend for reduced latency and improved performance.

4. **High Availability**: With redundancy across multiple regions, the global load balancer ensures that the application remains highly available, even if one region experiences issues.

5. **Scalability**: The global load balancer can handle large traffic volumes efficiently, scaling as needed to accommodate high user demand, which is vital for a social app with fluctuating traffic.

6. **Custom Domain and SSL**: The load balancer supports custom domains (e.g., `www.stravalikeapp.com`) and SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring secure and professional communication with users.

7. **Integration with Google Cloud**: Seamless integration with other Google Cloud services simplifies application deployment and management while enabling robust monitoring and logging.

By leveraging a **Global External Application Load Balancer**, the application ensures a secure, scalable, and performant experience for users posting and viewing workout activities.
