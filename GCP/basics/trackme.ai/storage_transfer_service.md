### Checklist for Migrating Data Using GCP Storage Transfer Service 

- [ ] **Step 1: Prepare AWS S3 Bucket for Migration**
  - [ ] Ensure the S3 bucket contains all the data to be migrated.
  - [ ] Configure bucket permissions to allow GCP access via the AWS IAM role.
    - Use case: Granting GCP read access to your trackme.ai datasets stored in AWS.
  - [ ] Ensure the AWS S3 bucket is in the correct region for optimal data transfer speed.

- [ ] **Step 2: Set Up Google Cloud Storage Bucket**
  - [ ] Create a destination GCS bucket in the appropriate region.
    - Use case: Choose a GCS region close to your application deployment region to reduce latency.
  - [ ] Configure GCS bucket settings for lifecycle management and access control.

- [ ] **Step 3: Configure IAM Roles and Permissions**
  - [ ] Grant necessary permissions in GCP to use Storage Transfer Service.
    - Roles: `roles/storage.admin`, `roles/storagetransfer.admin`.
  - [ ] Create an AWS IAM role with a trust relationship for GCP.
    - Use case: This allows GCP to authenticate and access your AWS S3 bucket securely.

- [ ] **Step 4: Create a Storage Transfer Job**
  - [ ] Define the source (AWS S3 bucket) and destination (GCS bucket).
  - [ ] Configure filters (optional) to migrate specific files or folders.
    - Use case: Only migrate trackme.ai logs or training datasets.

- [ ] **Step 5: Monitor and Validate the Transfer**
  - [ ] Watch the job progress in the GCP Console.
  - [ ] Validate that the data was successfully migrated.
    - Use case: Verify that sensitive trackme.ai datasets were transferred correctly.

- [ ] **Step 6: Post-Migration Steps**
  - [ ] Update application configurations in trackme.ai to use the GCS bucket.
  - [ ] Set up data lifecycle policies in the GCS bucket.
    - Use case: Automate data archival or deletion for cost optimization.

### Detailed Steps for Migration

#### **Step 1: Prepare AWS S3 Bucket**
1. **Ensure Data Readiness**
   - Organize datasets in the S3 bucket into folders (e.g., `logs/`, `datasets/`).
   - Validate the data structure matches the expected format in your GCP workflows.

2. **Set Up AWS Permissions**
   - Create an IAM role with the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy.
   - Add a trust relationship to allow GCP's Storage Transfer Service to assume this role:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": {
             "Service": "storagetransfer.googleapis.com"
           },
           "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

#### **Step 2: Set Up Google Cloud Storage Bucket**
1. **Create a GCS Bucket**
   - Use the GCP Console or Cloud CLI:
     ```bash
     gsutil mb -l <region> gs://<bucket-name>
     ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     gsutil mb -l us-central1 gs://trackme-ai-data
     ```

2. **Set Bucket Permissions**
   - Assign `roles/storage.admin` to the service account managing the migration.

#### **Step 3: Configure IAM Roles and Permissions**
1. **Grant GCP Permissions**
   - Assign the following roles to your service account in GCP:
     - `roles/storage.admin`
     - `roles/storagetransfer.admin`

2. **Set Up AWS Permissions**
   - Attach the IAM role to your AWS S3 bucket.

#### **Step 4: Create a Storage Transfer Job**
1. **Launch the Storage Transfer Service**
   - Navigate to GCP Console → **Storage Transfer** → **Create Transfer Job**.
   - Select **Amazon S3** as the source.

2. **Configure the Job**
   - Source: Enter AWS S3 bucket name.
   - Destination: Select the GCS bucket created earlier.
   - Filters: Optionally include/exclude specific files or folders.

3. **Schedule the Job**
   - Choose whether to run the job once or schedule periodic transfers.

#### **Step 5: Monitor and Validate the Transfer**
1. **Monitor Progress**
   - Go to GCP Console → **Storage Transfer** → **Transfer Jobs**.
   - Check for errors and ensure all files are migrated.

2. **Validate Integrity**
   - Use `gsutil` to verify data:
     ```bash
     gsutil ls -r gs://<bucket-name>
     ```

#### **Step 6: Post-Migration Steps**
1. **Update Application Configurations**
   - Update your application (e.g., **trackme.ai**) to use the GCS bucket URL.

2. **Set Up Lifecycle Policies**
   - Example: Archive data older than 30 days:
     ```json
     {
       "rule": [
         {
           "action": {"type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "ARCHIVE"},
           "condition": {"age": 30}
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### Real-World Use Case for trackme.ai

- **Scenario:** Migrating user data and machine learning datasets from AWS S3 to GCP for reduced costs and better integration with GCP services like BigQuery and Vertex AI.
- **Solution:** Use the Storage Transfer Service to automate periodic data migrations. Store training datasets in GCS and process them using Vertex AI.
