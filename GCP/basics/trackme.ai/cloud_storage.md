### Cloud Storage Best Practices for TrackMe.ai

Here is a checklist of best practices for setting up Google Cloud Storage tailored to TrackMe.ai's use cases like uploading workouts, logs, leaderboards, and messaging.

---

#### **1. General Cloud Storage Best Practices**
- [ ] **Organize Buckets by Use Case**  
  Use separate buckets for:
  - Workouts (e.g., `trackmeai-workouts`).
  - Logs (e.g., `trackmeai-logs`).
  - Leaderboards (e.g., `trackmeai-leaderboards`).
  - Messaging (e.g., `trackmeai-messaging`).

- [ ] **Implement Bucket-Level Permissions**  
  Use IAM roles to restrict access:
  - `roles/storage.objectAdmin` for upload use cases.
  - `roles/storage.objectViewer` for read-only access (leaderboard viewers).

- [ ] **Enable Bucket Versioning**  
  Protect against accidental deletions or overwrites by enabling versioning for all critical buckets.

- [ ] **Set Lifecycle Rules**  
  Automate object management:
  - Archive logs older than 30 days to reduce costs.
  - Delete unused messaging files after 90 days.

#### **2. Security**
- [ ] **Use VPC Service Controls**  
  Isolate buckets to prevent unauthorized access from outside your network.

- [ ] **Encrypt Data**  
  Use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for sensitive data like personal workout logs or messaging.

- [ ] **Audit Access Logs**  
  Enable Access Transparency and Bucket Logging to track who accessed or modified the files.

#### **3. Performance Optimizations**
- [ ] **Optimize for Large File Uploads**  
  Use `gsutil` or parallel composite uploads for faster uploading of large workout or log files.

- [ ] **Enable GCS Notifications**  
  Set up Pub/Sub notifications for messaging or leaderboard updates.

#### **4. Cost Management**
- [ ] **Select Proper Storage Class**  
  - **Standard** for frequently accessed leaderboards or messaging.
  - **Nearline/Coldline** for logs or archived workouts.

- [ ] **Monitor Usage**  
  Use GCP Cloud Monitoring to keep track of storage usage and avoid unexpected costs.

#### **Use Cases**
##### **Uploading Workouts**
- Use signed URLs for secure, short-lived access to upload workout files directly from the client app.
- Enable resumable uploads for large video or data files.

##### **Logs**
- Ship application logs to a dedicated bucket using Stackdriver Logging sinks.
- Store logs in `Coldline` or `Archive` storage for infrequent access.

##### **Leaderboards**
- Use GCS as a backend for serving pre-computed leaderboard data to users.
- Implement public-read access for static leaderboard files.

##### **Messaging**
- Use GCS to temporarily store message payloads before sending them to recipients or processing.
