## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Manage permissions and access to GCP resources.

### Topics to Study
- [ ] **IAM Roles and Permissions**  
  - Learn about predefined, custom, and basic roles.
  - Use Case: Grant least privilege access to users.  
- [ ] **Service Accounts**  
  - Understand how to authenticate applications.  
  - Example: Use a service account for a Compute Engine instance to access Cloud Storage.  
- [ ] **Organization Policies**  
  - Enforce security policies and constraints.
