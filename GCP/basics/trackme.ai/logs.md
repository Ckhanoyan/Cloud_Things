# Logs and Audit Logs in Google Cloud for trackme.ai

## **Overview**
Google Cloud provides robust tools to track logs and audit activities across your projects. For trackme.ai, where you manage tasks like uploading workouts, staff database management, and networking, setting up proper logging and monitoring is essential for security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

## **Core Services**

### 1. **Cloud Logging**
   - **Purpose**: Captures logs from Google Cloud services and your applications.
   - **Use Case**: Track errors in workout upload processes, monitor database performance, and analyze network traffic.
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Use **structured logging** to include metadata like request ID, timestamp, and severity.
     - Configure **log sinks** to export logs to **BigQuery** for advanced analytics or **Cloud Storage** for long-term retention.

### 2. **Cloud Audit Logs**
   - **Purpose**: Records administrative, data, and policy access actions on Google Cloud resources.
   - **Use Case**: Trace who accessed or modified the staff database or network configurations.
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Enable **Admin Activity Logs** and **Data Access Logs** for all projects.
     - Regularly review logs for unauthorized changes or suspicious activity.

### 3. **Cloud Monitoring**
   - **Purpose**: Provides dashboards, alerts, and metrics derived from log data.
   - **Use Case**: Set up alerts for unusual spikes in workout upload errors or database query failures.
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Define **uptime checks** and **alerting policies** for critical workflows.
     - Use **custom metrics** to monitor application-specific events like successful workout uploads.

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Step 1: Enable Logging and Audit Logs**
- [ ] Navigate to the **Google Cloud Console**.
- [ ] Go to **Logging > Logs Explorer**.
- [ ] Verify that **Cloud Logging** is enabled for all services in your projects.
- [ ] Enable **Cloud Audit Logs**:
  - [ ] Verify that Admin Activity Logs are enabled by default.
  - [ ] Enable **Data Access Logs** for more granular insights.

### **Step 2: Organize Logs by Resource**
- [ ] Identify key resources to monitor:
  - **GCE Instances**: Track workout upload servers.
  - **Cloud SQL**: Monitor staff database queries.
  - **Cloud Load Balancer**: Log incoming requests to your networking infrastructure.

### **Step 3: Create Log-Based Metrics**
- [ ] Open the **Logs Explorer** in the Cloud Console.
- [ ] Search for specific logs (e.g., errors in workout uploads).
- [ ] Create **log-based metrics** for:
  - [ ] Frequency of errors.
  - [ ] API call latency.
  - [ ] Database query performance.

### **Step 4: Configure Log Sinks**
- [ ] Export logs for deeper analysis:
  - [ ] To **BigQuery**: Analyze trends in workout uploads or staff database usage.
  - [ ] To **Cloud Storage**: Retain raw logs for compliance audits.
  - [ ] To **Pub/Sub**: Trigger workflows based on log data (e.g., notify the team about suspicious database activities).

### **Step 5: Set Up Alerts**
- [ ] In **Cloud Monitoring**, create alerts based on log metrics:
  - [ ] Notify the team if workout upload error rates exceed 5%.
  - [ ] Alert when unauthorized database access is detected.

### **Step 6: Visualize Logs**
- [ ] Use **Cloud Monitoring Dashboards** to visualize logs:
  - [ ] Create widgets for key metrics like successful workout uploads, database query times, and network traffic anomalies.

## **Best Practices Checklist**
- [ ] **Centralize Logs**: Use **Cloud Logging buckets** to consolidate logs across all projects.
- [ ] **Retention Policies**: Define retention periods based on compliance requirements (e.g., 30 days for operational logs, 365 days for audit logs).
- [ ] **Access Control**: Use **IAM roles** to restrict who can view, export, or modify logs.
- [ ] **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic log reviews to identify patterns and potential security risks.
- [ ] **Automate Responses**: Use **Cloud Functions** or **Workflows** to automate responses to critical log events.
