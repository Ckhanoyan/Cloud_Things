# TrackMe.ai – Google Cloud Pub/Sub Architecture Checklist

## Core Service: Pub/Sub
> **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** is a fully-managed, real-time messaging service for event-driven systems, decoupling microservices, data pipelines, and IoT devices.  
> [Official Docs](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs)

## Checklist for Designing Pub/Sub for TrackMe.ai

### [ ] **1. Identify the Events to Publish**
- Define event types (e.g., “Device location update”, “Device health update”, “Alert triggered”).
- Design event payload structure (e.g., JSON with `device_id`, `timestamp`, `coordinates`, `battery_status`).
- **Use Case:**  
  TrackMe.ai devices send their location every minute. Each device POSTs to an API, which publishes to Pub/Sub.

---

### [ ] **2. Set Up Topics**
- Create Pub/Sub topics for each event type.
  - Examples:
      - `device-location-updates`
      - `device-health-updates`
      - `alerts`
- Organize topics by environment (e.g., `prod-device-location-updates`).
- **Use Case:**  
  Each topic acts as a “channel” for a specific message type, improving scalability and organization.

---

### [ ] **3. Implement Publishers**
- Build publisher clients (API Gateway, Cloud Functions, etc.).
- Use GCP client libraries (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).
- [Document publisher logic](https://github.com/Ckhanoyan/Cloud_Things/blob/main/GCP/basics/trackme.ai/pub_sub.md).
- **Use Case:**  
  A Cloud Function receives device HTTP requests and publishes messages to the correct topic.

---

### [ ] **4. Create Subscriptions**
- Set up subscriptions for each topic:
  - Pull subscriptions: backend services poll messages.
  - Push subscriptions: GCP pushes to a webhook endpoint.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Backend service subscribes to `device-location-updates` and writes to BigQuery.
  - Another service subscribes to `alerts` and sends notifications.

---

### [ ] **5. Enable Processing and Fan-out**
- Multiple subscribers per topic (analytics, notifications, dashboards).
- **Use Case:**  
  - Analytics: All locations go to BigQuery for analysis.
  - Real-time dashboard: Updates live maps as messages arrive.

---

### [ ] **6. Secure with IAM**
- Grant publish and subscribe permissions (service accounts, least privilege).
- Devices/gateways: Publish-only.
- Backend services: Subscribe/process.
- **Use Case:**  
  Ensure only authorized services can publish/subscribe.

---

### [ ] **7. Monitoring & Error Handling**
- Set up monitoring, logging, and dead letter topics.
- Monitor undelivered messages and handle processing failures.
- **Use Case:**  
  Unprocessed messages go to a dead letter queue for manual review.

---

### [ ] **8. Scalability & Real-World Considerations**
- Ensure high throughput with Pub/Sub’s auto-scaling.
- Enable message ordering if needed.
- Set message retention for replay.
- **Use Case:**  
  Pub/Sub scales for thousands of device messages per minute and allows analytics teams to replay old data.
