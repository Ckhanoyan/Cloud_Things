### **Checklist: Enabling Cross-Project Cloud Storage Access**

#### **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
- [ ] **Identify the Service Account for the VM in Project A**  
  - Locate the VM in **Compute Engine**.  
  - Check the **attached service account**.  

- [ ] **Grant Permissions to the Service Account in Project B**  
  - In **Project B (trackme.ai)**, navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **IAM**.  
  - Add the service account from **Project A** as a member.  
  - Assign appropriate roles:  
    - **Storage Object Viewer** (`roles/storage.objectViewer`) for read-only access.  
    - **Storage Admin** (`roles/storage.objectAdmin`) for full access.  

#### **Cloud Storage**
- [ ] **Configure Bucket Permissions in Project B**  
  - Navigate to **Cloud Storage** in **Project B**.  
  - Select the bucket and click **Permissions**.  
  - Add the service account from **Project A** with the role.  

#### **Networking (Optional)**
- [ ] **Set Up Networking** *(if private communication is needed)*  
  - Consider **VPC Network Peering** or **Shared VPC**.  
  - Configure firewall rules to allow traffic between the VM and the bucket.  

#### **Validation**
- [ ] **Test Access from VM in Project A**  
  - SSH into the VM and use **gsutil** to access the bucket:  
    ```bash
    gsutil ls gs://<bucket-name>
    ```  

#### **Advanced Security**
- [ ] **Consider Workload Identity Federation**  
  - Use for enhanced security and avoiding service account key sharing.

### **Use Case: Cross-Project Data Processing**
**Scenario:** A VM in **Project A** processes raw data stored in a Cloud Storage bucket in **Project B**.  
1. The VM downloads raw data from **Project B's bucket**.  
2. Processes the data locally or via BigQuery integration.  
3. Uploads the processed results back to **Project A's Cloud Storage**.  

This setup supports scalable data pipelines while ensuring proper IAM and networking configurations.
