## Notes
- Before starting the migration, ensure that all stakeholders understand the differences between AWS and GCP services.
- Use GCP’s [Migrate for Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine) for VM migrations.
- Take advantage of GCP’s [Database Migration Service](https://cloud.google.com/database-migration) for smooth database transitions.
- Test every service post-migration to ensure the app functions as expected in the new environment.
