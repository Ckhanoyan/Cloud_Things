# cloud_things

I am passionate about learning and documenting cloud concepts and capabilities. I hold certifications in AWS, Azure, and OCI, and I am currently focused on expanding my expertise by studying for the Google Cloud Professional Architect certification. This repository is a space where I document my learning process, share insights, and explore various aspects of cloud computing while developing practical skills in GCP.

Feel free to explore and connect with me as I continue my journey in the ever-evolving world of cloud technologies.

Cheers!
